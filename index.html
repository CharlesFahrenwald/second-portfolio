                        <h3>Here's a couple of facts about me</h3>
                        <p>I am a software enginner located currently in Tucson, Arizona and enjoy spending time coding and hiking.</p>

                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>I grew up in a small town in Illinois called Warrenville approximately two hours outside of the city of Chicago. I recently moved to Arizona because I loved how different the state felt, the mountain hiking is extremely fun and enjoyable.</p>
		                <p>I originally had  plans of going to college for an enginnering degree, at the time I wasn't sure of which enginnering degree I wanted to pursue. After enough thinking I decieded to go into software enginnering and so far love it.</p> 
	                    <p> I believe software enginnering to me is a perfect fit since I already love computers I have bulit both of my personal computer for gaming and work. I also enjoy working on team projects sharing opinions and and coming up with solutions creativly for problems that occur. 	</p>
